		<p>25% Auditory</p>
		<h3>Quantitative Accomplishments</h3>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc"> MCAC Scholar Athlete</li>
			<li type="disc"> Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society member</li>
			<li type="disc"> First aid and CPR certified</li>
			<li type="disc"> (relevant coursework section)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Qualitative Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc"> Strong analytical/critical problem solving skills</li>
			<li type="disc"> Demonstrated ability to breakdown and teach complex topics</li>
			<li type="disc"> Patiently persistent </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Whole Brain</h3>
		<ul>
			<li type="none">My<strong> right brain</strong> is visually oriented, allowing me to initially approach<br/>
				large, complex problems from a big picture perspective. I love listening to and creating music. I <br/>
				relax through moving my body in sports, dance and yoga. I use my intuition as a compass to guide my <br/>
				life and interpersonal relationships. In my work, I focus serving and empowering others to live their <br/>
				fullest expression of themselves.
			</li>
			<li type="none">My<strong> left brain</strong> is able to break big, complex problems into small, procedural<br/>
			steps; finding order in chaos. This analytical processing is the foundation for the work I do in STEM and<br/>
				in cs/engineering. I love love love understanding how things work. This serves me in my passion for <br/>
			technology, physics, coding. Using this problem solving in tandem with my right brain, I am able to <br/>
			allow a strong sense of wonder and determination when I teach. </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
		<ul style="list-style-type: none">
			<li type="disc">Why?</li>
			<li type="none">I want to make stem more accessible
			for people that aren't normally included.</li>
			<li type="disc">How?</li>
			<li type="none">Develop my skills in coding, cs/engineering and
			entrepreneurial training. <br/>Pursue higher education to open doors.</li>
			<li type="disc">What?</li>
			<li type="none">Continuing my work in education by creating STEAM camps,
			building <br/>a company that focuses on people/ideas outside of the "tech bubble."</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
		<h4>Version 1</h4>
		<p>Hi my name is Chamisa. I own a company that creates access
			for under served and high risk <br/>populations to project-based
			learning opportunities in STEM. Are you an educator <br/> or know
			anybody that might be interested in one of our courses?</p>
		<h4>Version 2</h4>
		<p>(I changed the focus of my elevator pitch to something more immediately applicable)</p>
		<p>Hi, my name is Chamisa. I'm an engineering student and recently<br/>
			graduated from the CNM fullstack web development bootcamp. I'm <br/>
		really interested in machine learning, AI and figuring out how the IoT<br/>
			can be leveraged by underserved populations. Do you know someone <br/>
			that might be interested in bringing in a fresh software developer/engineering student?</p>
		<h4>Version 2.1</h4>
		Hi, my name is Chamisa. I'm an engineering student and recently<br/>

		graduated from the CNM fullstack web development bootcamp. I'm<br/>

		really interested in empowering underserved populations to utilize machine learning,<br/>

		AI and the IoT to help their communities. Do you know someone doing<br/>

		similar work that might be interested in bringing in a web dev/engineering student?<br/><br/>
		<h3>Visual Speaks</h3>
		<p>I am gathering the tools to manifest my inner vision.</p>

			<h3>Stove top</h3>
			<p><strong>Front of the stove:</strong> Learn lots of code, get into grad school<br/>
				<strong>Back of the stove:</strong> Get an apartment/car and plan a startup!<br/><br/>
				<strong>Non-profit:</strong> AISES; As a non-profit I think this could be a strategic option since this<br/>
				academic society works with most universities and colleges in the United States. It would allow me the<br/>
				opportunity to build relationships with professionals and learn what is possible in terms of funding for<br/>
				graduate school after I'm done with Deep Dive. <br/><br/>
				<strong>For profit:</strong> Think Ubiquitous, LLC; I want to intern with a company that deals in <br/>
				nerdy sciencey stuff. I especially loved that they work in all sorts of fields with all types of data.<br/>
				If it were possible to pitch an idea to them as an internship project that directly affects tribes and <br/>
				the environment, I definitely would. I am very intimidated by their internship test though..<br/><br/>
				<strong>Salary expectations and potential:</strong> Realistically, I expect to use this bootcamp to get <br/>
				an internship. With an internship, I will probably be working part-time, hourly for the next semester. <br/>
				Ideally, I will have a schedule that allows for $15/hr, 20-30 hours per week. After I gain enough skill<br/>
				I will want to move onto a more flexible, remote position that allows me to go to graduate school. <br/>
				As I build my portfolio, I will expect to charge per project. In a freelance role, I would expect <br/>
				to make somewhere around 32,000/yr, which evens out to about $15/hr. <br/>

		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<h3>Week 1</h3>
		<p>This week has been challenging since we have definitely hit the ground running. This week we've worked<br/>
		heavily on quickly putting together simple html websites and deploying them on the server. Since I am definitely<br/>
			still learning, this website is an example of how I may not be doing the correct thing in deployment. We<br/>
		just finished up listening to Chloe talk about asking questions and maintaining a growth mindset, so I'll go<br/>
		ask for help! :) </p>
		<h3>Week 2</h3>
		<p>We have been working on our data design projects throughout week 2. For me, this week has been a little more<br/>
		challenging than last week since I have had a couple fast deadlines for work that have taken my full <br/>
		attention. I am still trying to understand the assignment flow for the bootcamp to better plan my time. <br/>
			We have a group meetup planned for Saturday that will hopefully clear up some questions I have from <br/>
		this week's lectures. On the prodev side, we got to hear from a couple local businesses. I am really interested<br/>
		in getting in contact with the Think Ubiquitous team to possible intern with them. Their work sounded awesome!</p>
		<h3>Week 3</h3>
		<p>I have no idea where this week went! It finally feels like it's possible to gain some traction on assignments<br/>
		that are due in the next week. On Friday we were able to sit in on the digital media graduation. It was really <br/>
		cool to see what they've been working on! I'm almost concerned I chose the wrong bootcamp! I had a family emergency<br/>
		and had to step out early, but I heard that the projects were awesome, and it really excites me to think about<br/>
		all of the cool ways technology can be utilized to facilitate learning. </p>
		<h3>Week 4</h3>
		<p>This week has been pretty busy for me. I'm under a little more pressure from the work side of my life, and<br/>
		it's becoming an interesting balancing act between work/class/sleep/life. I missed one component of a PWP milestone<br/>
			and was docked a tier or two which is disappointing. I need to figure out how to organize bootcamp<br/>
			details in a more efficient way going forward. This weekend the capstone team will be attending a stargazing <br/>
		party to gather information on the direction of our project and how the idea will float with them. We are staying<br/>
		ahead of most of the hard deadlines so far and working pretty well as a team so far. Playing the game was a <br/>
		really fun experiment. Even though we accidentally cheated, it is a game that we'll probably revisit it again.<br/>
		The prodev presentations this week were pretty sweet! I commented on Erik's photo that I'd really like to learn how <br/>
		to learn to build things with some of the web dev languages we're learning. I love building things and when I<br/>
		saw this bootcamp, I hoped that I could somehow utilize this course in engineering too. </p>
