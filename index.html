		<h3>Whole Brain</h3>
		<ul>
			<li type="none">My<strong> right Brain</strong> is visually oriented, allowing me to initially approach<br/>
				large, complex problems from a big picture perspective. I love listening to and creating music. I <br/>
				relax through moving my body in sports, dance and yoga. I use my intuition as a compass to guide my <br/>
				life and interpersonal relationships. In my work, I focus serving and empowering others to live their <br/>
				fullest expression of themselves.
			</li>
			<li type="none">My<strong>left Brain</strong> is able to break big, complex problems into small, procedural<br/>
			steps; finding order in chaos. This analytical processing is the foundation for the work I do in STEM and<br/>
				in cs/engineering. I love love love understanding how things work. This serves me in my passion for <br/>
			technology, physics, coding. Using this problem solving in tandem with my right brain, I am able to <br/>
			allow a strong sense of wonder and determination when I teach. </li>

		<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
		<h4>Version 1</h4>
		<p>Hi my name is Chamisa. I own a company that creates access
			for under served and high risk populations to project-based
			learning opportunities in STEM. Are you an educator or know
			anybody that might be interested in one of our courses?</p>
		<h4>Version 2</h4>
		<p>Pending...</p>
		<h3>Visual Speaks</h3>
		<p>I am still a little unclear about what goes into this section.</p>
		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<h3>Week 1</h3>
		<p>This week has been challenging since we have definitely hit the ground running. This week we've worked<br/>
		heavily on quickly putting together simple html websites and deploying them on the server. Since I am definitely<br/>
			still learning, this website is an example of how I may not be doing the correct thing in deployment. We<br/>
		just finished up listening to Chloe talk about asking questions and maintaining a growth mindset, so I'll go<br/>
		ask for help! :) </p>
		<h3>Week 2</h3>
		<p>This week hasn't happened yet. Stay tuned...</p>
